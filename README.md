# IPL-Cricket-Match-Analysis
**Situation:** The objective was to develop a comprehensive IPL match data analysis tool utilizing Rapid API's Cricbuzz Cricket API. The aim was to offer real-time insights into live team scores, batting and bowling scores, toss results, and other pertinent match statistics.

**Task:** Integrating data from various sources, including the Cricbuzz Cricket API for live match data and IPL_Player_summary.csv for player information, was the primary task. Addressing missing player images by manually downloading and hosting them on postimages.org, along with incorporating team logos from Team Logo.csv, was also crucial.

**Action:** Merge queries were employed to seamlessly integrate player images into relevant tables. Custom columns were created to enable dynamic calculation of the current score. Furthermore, numerous measures were developed to enhance the depth of analysis.

**Result:** The outcome was a dynamic IPL match data analysis tool that delivered real-time insights into matches between two teams. It showcased vital information such as team names, inning numbers, total runs/wickets (overs), run rates, number of twos, sixes, and fours, along with comprehensive bowling and batting tables and individual batsman contributions.
